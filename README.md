Created by me and my friend in Damascus University.

```

then run it.

## About the project:

### 1. Tools:

-   What we used to create the app: Swing, AWT, Collections, Multithreading, OOP.

### 2. General Idea:

-   Using CardLayout System, we created some panels, and each one has a functionality to do (ex: Order, Kitchen, ..etc).
-   Handling all types of orders: (Take away, on table, Deliviry) and paying methods.
-   Report panel for showing statistics about profits and other things.
